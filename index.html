<h3>Short Bio</h3>
<p>My name is Pavan Reddy Bommana. I am currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science at University of Massachusetts, Amherst.
  I am doing a data science concentration in my Masters. I enjoy developing data-intensive systems that solve specific problems using machine learning techniques.
<p>Prior to this I spent two years at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/acceletrade/">Acceletrade Technologies</a>, a high-frequency trading firm based out of Bangalore, India. I worked on some challenging problems in the fintech domain during my stint there. As a result, I developed an acute interest in working on problems in the intersection of finance and machine learning. I also have a Bachelors degree (Honours) in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur.</p>


<h3>Soon to be updated...</h3>
<p>Stay tuned for updates. I'll soon be starting a blog on findings in my areas of interest.</p>
<p>In the mean while feel free to reach out to me to discuss about exciting ideas and opportunities you might have.</p>
